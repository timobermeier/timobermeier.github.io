## Research Papers

**The Marriage Market, Inequality and the Progressivity of the Income Tax**

<div style="text-align: justify">
This paper studies how the progressivity of the income tax affects intra-household inequality and the marriage market. Tax progressivity increases the after-tax earnings of the lower-earning spouse and improves their bargaining position in marriage. This mechanism reduces inequality in consumption and leisure within households. In addition, tax progressivity can change who is single and who marries whom. I study these effects in an equilibrium search and matching model with intra-household bargaining, labor supply and savings. The model is calibrated to data from the Netherlands and used to study a hypothetical reform which increases progressivity by 40% relative to the current system. The reduction of intra-household inequality accounts for 24.77% of the reduction in inequality in private consumption due to the reform, and 11.43% of the reduction in inequality in welfare from private and public consumption, leisure and home production. Marriage rates increase especially for men with relatively low ability.

**Employer Screening and Optimal Unemployment Insurance** (with Mario Meier)
[[Draft](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tAGvMMD41NnBfn5gcK0CyfQrfQYDxN-5)]

Field experiments have shown that that employers are less likely to consider long-term unemployed job-seekers for interviews. This paper studies how firms' screening behavior affects the optimal design of unemployment insurance. We build a model of the job search and recruitment process in which firms have limited information about the productivity of each applicant and make interviewing and hiring decisions based on unemployment duration and a noisy signal about productivity. Unemployment insurance affects the probability of being hired by changing firms' beliefs about productivity, the composition of the pool of applicants, and the mean number of applications per vacancy. We estimate our model using German data and use the estimated model for policy analysis. The optimal schedule is more generous in the beginning and pays benefits longer, but less generous for long durations. With the optimal schedule, hiring probabilities increase for job-seekers with intermediate and long durations. We decopose this increase into the three mechanisms and find that it is mainly due to changes in the pool of applicants. Changes in beliefs and in the applications-per-vacancy ratio play a smaller role.
