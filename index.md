I'm a Post-Doc Fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. I completed the Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Mannheim in 2019. My research interests are in Public Economics, Macroeconomics and Labor Economics - in particular, topics related to family behavior, unemployment and inequality.

### Research Papers

**The Marriage Market, Inequality and the Progressivity of the Income Tax**

This paper studies how the progressivity of the income tax affects intra-household inequality and the marriage market. Tax progressivity increases the after-tax earnings of the lower-earning spouse and improves their bargaining position in marriage. This mechanism reduces inequality in consumption and leisure within households. In addition, tax progressivity can change who is single and who marries whom. I study these effects in an equilibrium search and matching model with intra-household bargaining, labor supply and savings. The model is calibrated to data from the Netherlands and used to study a hypothetical reform which increases progressivity by 40% relative to the current system. The reduction of intra-household inequality accounts for 16.5% of the reduction in inequality in private consumption due to the reform, and 6.9% of the reduction in inequality in welfare from private and public consumption, leisure and home production. Marriage rates increase especially for men with relatively low ability.

**Employer Screening and Optimal Unemployment Insurance** (with Mario Meier)

This paper studies how firms' screening behavior affects the optimal design of unemployment policies. In our model, firms receive multiple applications and make selective interview decisions among applicants, combining the information from a noisy signal about productivity and unemployment duration. UI benefits affect the pool of applications that firms receive and how informative duration is relative to the signal. We estimate the model using German administrative employment records and information on job search behavior, vacancies and applications. The model matches the observed decline in search effort, job finding rates and interview rates with increased unemployment duration. We find that allowing for employer screening is quantitatively important for the optimal design of unemployment insurance. Benefits should be paid for a longer period of time and be more generous in the beginning, but more restrictive afterwards, compared to the case where we treat the hiring and interview decisions of firms as exogenous.
